# Contributing

Hello, and welcome to the Morrowind 2019 guide.

If you're looking to help us out with contributions, here's some brief info to help you get started.

## Pull Request Process

* Anyone can submit a Pull Request with changes they'd like to see made (add/remove mods, add mods as alternates, formatting fixes, etc)
* A PR should ideally reference an issue. If there's no issue already open, open it first. IE, if you're adding a missing patch, make an issue something like "Add missing patch X to mod Y", then reference that issue number in the PR. If you can't be bothered to, it's understandable. However, an issue helps people discuss the topic beforehand and keep track of what's been done. 

### Our Standards

* The overall goal of the guide is to be as clear as possible. If anything is vague to someone installing the guide, that's bad. If you're adding a mod, does its file structure need changing to install properly? What options in the BAIN installer should be taken? What about these optional files? What plugins? Etc. Don't leave anything vague or up to chance if at all possible. 

### Scope

* Mods, extenders and tools of all kinds are welcome, as well as sections explaining *how* to mod the game (like cleaning mods, testing, etc). The only major consideration is massive overhauls like Tamriel Rebuilt. For these, the guide would need to have specific instructions for nearly every mod, which is tedious and unclean. If you want to approach that, fork the guide instead.

### Other Notes

You can directly edit/fork from Github, or fork using something like Github Desktop and edit using something like Notepad++. However, you might find [Typora](https://typora.io/) to be a useful tool for Markdown editing. It allows you to simultaneously preview and write in markdown, which is nice.
